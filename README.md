Answers for Problem Solving Section of HackerRank in Python.

In HackerRank, there is huge set of questions to practice problems. Each Problem is categorized in sub sections as EASY,MEDIUM,HARD etc. Not Only Problem Solving section, but there are other sections as well such as AI,SQL,Python,Java etc.

In this Repo, I'll be posting codes I wrote in Probelm Solving section of HackerRank.

These solutions are specifically in Python lang, however, can be solved in other programming languages as well. But, PYTHON IS LOVE.

# NOTE
Whatever solutions are provided, I have only included the code requiered by the user to write i.e. the target function, rest requiered code is already present in most of the questions by the website.
